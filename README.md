## Getting Started

This is a simple example of how we could read data from any api , either a list or a specific data . It is my first practical exercise that I upload to github as public, I hope you like it.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
  - `models`: the folder contains the classes to read this specific api
  - `utils`: the folder contains the methods to read the api
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
